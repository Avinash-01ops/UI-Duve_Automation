[2025-08-26T12:26:15.526Z] [CONSOLE:INFO] Slow network is detected. See https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5636954674692096 for more details. Fallback font will be used while loading: https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/roboto/v48/KFO7CnqEu92Fr1ME7kSn66aGLdTylUAMa3yUBA.woff2
[2025-08-26T12:26:17.595Z] [CONSOLE:WARNING] Amplitude Logger [Warn]: `options.defaultTracking` is set to undefined. This implicitly configures your Amplitude instance to track Page Views, Sessions, File Downloads, and Form Interactions. You can suppress this warning by explicitly setting a value to `options.defaultTracking`. The value must either be a boolean, to enable and disable all default events, or an object, for advanced configuration. For example:

amplitude.init(<YOUR_API_KEY>, {
  defaultTracking: true,
});

Visit https://www.docs.developers.amplitude.com/data/sdks/browser-2/#tracking-default-events for more details.
