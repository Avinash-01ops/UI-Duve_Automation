[2025-08-27T10:40:04.126Z] [CONSOLE:WARNING] [JavaScript Warning: "“duve.com” has been classified as a bounce tracker. If it does not receive user activation within the next 3,600 seconds it will have its state purged."]
[2025-08-27T10:40:09.423Z] [CONSOLE:WARNING] Amplitude Logger [Warn]: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.
[2025-08-27T10:40:09.688Z] [CONSOLE:WARNING] Amplitude Logger [Warn]: `options.defaultTracking` is set to undefined. This implicitly configures your Amplitude instance to track Page Views, Sessions, File Downloads, and Form Interactions. You can suppress this warning by explicitly setting a value to `options.defaultTracking`. The value must either be a boolean, to enable and disable all default events, or an object, for advanced configuration. For example:

amplitude.init(<YOUR_API_KEY>, {
  defaultTracking: true,
});
