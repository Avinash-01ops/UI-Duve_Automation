[2025-08-27T10:40:22.761Z] [CONSOLE:WARNING] Amplitude Logger [Warn]: Load failed
[2025-08-27T10:40:22.762Z] [CONSOLE:ERROR] Service Worker registration failed: TypeError: Script https://sandbox.duve.com/sw.js load failed
[2025-08-27T10:40:22.842Z] [CONSOLE:WARNING] Amplitude Logger [Warn]: `options.defaultTracking` is set to undefined. This implicitly configures your Amplitude instance to track Page Views, Sessions, File Downloads, and Form Interactions. You can suppress this warning by explicitly setting a value to `options.defaultTracking`. The value must either be a boolean, to enable and disable all default events, or an object, for advanced configuration. For example:

amplitude.init(<YOUR_API_KEY>, {
  defaultTracking: true,
});
